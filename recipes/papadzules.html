    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is a classic Mayan dish from Yucatán made with the minimum of
      ingredients. Warmed corn tortillas are dipped into a pumpkin seed sauce
      from which the green oil has been extracted, and flavored with epazote.
      The tortillas are filled with chopped hard-cooked egg and topped with a
      tomato sauce. The final touch is given by little decorative pools of the
      green oil. Great care has to be taken to ensure that these ingredients are
      the freshest — slightly rancid or bitter pumpkin seeds can ruin it — and
      great care also should be taken in the preparation.

    <h3>Ingredients for 12 papadzules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups (657ml) water</li>
      <li>2 large leafy stems of epazote</li>
      <li>1 scant teaspoon sea salt</li>
      <li>
        8 ounces (225g) hulled raw pumpkin seeds, about 1 2/3 cups (313ml)
      </li>
      <li>
        12 freshly made, warm corn tortillas, 5 to 5 1/2 inches (13-14cm) in
        diameter
      </li>
      <li>5 large hard-cooked eggs, shelled, roughly chopped, and salted</li>
      <li>1 cup (250ml) salsa</li>
      <li>
        2 large hard-cooked eggs, white and yolks separated and finely chopped
      </li>
      <li>12 epazote leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Have ready a warmed, not hot, serving dish or warmed individual dishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the water, epazote, and salt into a small pan and bring to a boil.
        Lower the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the pumpkin seeds in a thin layer over the bottom of a large
        skillet and heat through gently over low heat, turning them over from
        time to time. The seeds will swell, but take care not to let them become
        even slightly golden or the sauce will lose its fresh green color. You
        might want to keep a lid handy because often some of the seeds will
        start jumping out of the pan. Spread the seeds onto a metal tray to cool
        completely before grinding to avoid the blades seizing up with the
        volatile oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using an electric coffee/spice grinder, grind a portion of the seeds at
        a time to a slightly textured consistency, 5 to 6 seconds. If the seeds
        are ground too fine, then it will be more difficult to extract the oil.
      </li>
      <li>Have a small glass bowl ready for the oil.</li>
      <li>
        Put the ground seeds onto a plate that has a slight ridge around the
        rim. Measure out 1/4 cup (63ml) of the epazote broth and little by
        little sprinkle it — don't, for goodness' sake, pour the whole lot —
        over the seeds and work it with your hands, first having put the
        telephone on automatic answering. Gradually add the liquid until you
        have a crumbly but cohesive paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tilt the plate a little to one side and put a folded cloth underneath to
        hold it in that position. Start squeezing the paste and you will see
        that drops of oil will begin to extrude. Add a little more warm liquid
        if necessary — you probably won't need the whole amount — and keep
        squeezing until you have collected almost 4 tablespoons of dark green
        oil. (This is pure vitamin E, and great for the hands.) Crumble the
        paste into a blender jar, add the remaining strained epazote broth, if
        desired, and blend until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the sauce to a skillet and warm through over the lowest
        possible heat, stirring almost constantly because the starch content of
        the seeds begins to swell and the particles tend to coagulate in the
        bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip one of the warm tortillas into the sauce: it should be lightly
        covered. If the sauce is too thick, dilute it with a little extra warm
        water. Work as quickly as you can, dipping each tortilla into the sauce,
        holding it with tongs but supporting it with a spatula so you don't get
        left with a bit of broken tortilla in your tongs. Sprinkle some of the
        chopped egg across one-third of the tortilla, roll it up, and place it
        on the warmed dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        When all the papadzules are assembled, pour the remaining sauce over
        them. (If the sauce has thickened and become grainy looking, put it back
        into the blender with a little extra warm water and blend until smooth.)
        Now pour on the tomato sauce and sprinkle the chopped egg whites and
        yolks. Decorate with the optional epazote. As a final touch, spoon in
        little pools of the oil. Serve immediately or the oil will sink back
        into the sauce and all that work will have been for naught! Of course,
        it is more colorful and attractive to serve the papadzules together on
        one serving dish.
